# Write It Yourself

> This note is a reflective note to myself. However, I believe this kind of behavior is universal to many startups and thought it may be nice to share.

# Why are there so many words, but so little action?

After AI came out and with Deep Research and Meeting notes (which actually came out this year!), the cost to produce readable text has dropped massively. We never touch our keyboards, but this infinite text generator just writes so many damn words for us. Our meeting logs? AI. Our strategy doc? AI. Even our slides are AI now. Wonderful, we are living in an age where all visual communication mediums are produced not solely by humans but by an intelligent text generator.

This is great. I often use it too. However, the core issue is that no one reads it because 1,000,000 sloppy words are being produced every day and are being thrown around like it’s nothing. Sure, it took you 30 mins to write it, but for the reader, it takes 2 hours to fully comprehend the damn thing. Therefore, the reader will start using AI too, and will never get the full picture. 

This creates an awful situation for startups which require teams to work closely. Having an AI build a summary and asking questions to AI does not equal a comprehensive understanding. Do you really understand the big picture? The full context? The crux of the strategy/argument? Sure, you may have understood parts of the Q&A but can you create a logical plan that you can execute? And the worst part is that the *writer* sometimes does not understand it either! 

What this leads to is a lack of well-coordinated work with shared context. When the reader just asks AI questions and forms an assumption based on that, most of the time it is in the wrong direction by 30-ish degrees. Then, when they act upon that assumption, they get criticized. This leads to lack of confidence (thinking they don’t “get it”), ultimately leading to less action. This makes people devalue documentation entirely. Thus, good documents are devalued as well. It is extremely difficult to create a SoT (source of truth) in a culture where documentation as a whole is devalued.

When SoT is devalued, the company will have fewer self-driven people, because there is no tangible shared direction. In such cases, most people in the corp have already internalized the notion that “documentation is a waste of time”, and the solution will be “more meetings”, “more talks in the office” and finally, “more micro-management”. This will lead to higher management costs, leading to less time invested in writing, and thus more text slop. The point here is that a manager who stops documenting themselves is making their lives harder by creating a negative feedback loop, leading to a less coordinated and less autonomous team.

# Why is writing so powerful?

After reading the paragraph above, you may say: “hey, even if we do not have any SoT, we still can be self-driven, by communicating and getting ideas across quickly”. Most often, this argument comes from people who communicate verbally. It is nice because they are quick, but it is also extremely fuzzy. When communicating verbally, people can push through flawed ideas by being loud or emotional. A matter that may have been agreed upon may not have any power at all next week because what people say keeps on changing based on time, emotions and mood. On the other hand, writing does not change due to your feelings. It only changes through rational discussion and concrete agreements. Thus, it is a much more powerful way to share context and use it as a source of truth.

# “You” have to write the doc to make it powerful, and have others act upon it

Most of the time, sloppy documents are written when you try to one-shot prompt something and copy-paste the document directly. No one sees your effort in a redundant document. You have to at least structure your argument/point, and write a very rough draft on your own before you throw it at AI. When doing so, I believe you should check the following points. (this is specific to those who are in a startup and want to create a document that acts as a source of truth to collaborate as a team)

- Clarity
    - Use easy language that everyone can understand.
    - Structure your argument specific to your context, not some AI assuming your context.
    - Make sure that you are not using dumbass AI-generated jargon.
- Conciseness
    - Don’t go over every single detail. You are in a startup and you have to choose what to communicate and what not to communicate.
- Accessibility
    - Choose the right medium to communicate. Is it a slide? Is it a document? A Slack message?
    - Make sure it is highly accessible for the team.

When you try to check all the boxes written above, you won’t be one-shotting AI slop with no effort. You will become very detailed with your prompts and will be doing *a lot* of fixing. 

Such an endeavor is not only beneficial for the team, but for you. You will be thinking more clearly, and will be more confident when you take on leadership.

# Documentation is work, not bullshit work.

I’ve written about the power of writing, and how it is beneficial. However, this trend of devaluing documentation, I believe, is not merely an individual mindset issue, but more of an organizational mindset issue. 

As a Japanese, I’ve come to think that we were never educated to make writing a habit. We are more often focused on tests which ask us to solve a specific problem one by one, with a maximum of 100 words written for each question. When we graduate and go into the big corps, I think the first thing we are taught is how to write. However, when such students, who are not trained in the art of writing, build a startup right away, they tend to form an organization so fixated on “actions” and “working hard”, that they neglect the power of “sitting down” and “writing well”. Thus, they optimize for “less time spent on writing”, leading to an increasing amount of AI written slops and chaos inside the office.

Therefore, we have to stop thinking that documentation is bullshit work. Documentation is a cognitive exercise to turn thoughts into tangible material that people can discuss. We have to put in effort to have the members spend time on documenting, and put less pressure to act immediately. It’s OK that the member has to spend 2 hours in front of the computer twice a week. The time spent will pay off in the long term.
